# VGP240_PixEngine
Understanding Game Engines & their Visualisation Logic by creating my own using Pix.

## Week 1 - Intro to Pix Engine and Simple Point & Colour functions

![Week_1_PixelArt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad173e55-a12f-4ceb-b170-7290d7958bd5)
- Made Pixel Art using the engine and direct colour coding.


## Week 2 - Vertex to Vertex Line & Triangle Functions

![Week_2_Line](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f38b19c6-0511-4e80-aba4-a655908d00f4)
- Visualisation of a Line with Colour Gradients, including Colour and Vertex Mathematics/ Logic.

![Week_2_Triangles](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62dcb641-c91c-4a9a-a74b-74f15cf14db9)
- As well as Triangle Visualisation With Wireframe & Fill Mode Logic and Colour Mathematics.


## Week 3 - Viewport & Clipping

![Clipping](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/048c3046-95e1-4cec-af44-a008aa2ae942)
- Created a Viewport, allowing us to allow for Clipping Logic.
- Implemented Clipping (Responsible for testing primitive visibility against the viewport boundaries).

## Week 4 - 4x4 Vector Math & Logic Implementation
- Implemented Matrix Operations, such as Determinants, Inverse, Cofactor and Dot Product.
- Allowing for Perspective Projections and eventually a Camera System!
